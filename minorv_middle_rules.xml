<section anchor="sec:rules" title="The Minor Versioning Rules">
  <t>
    The following items represent the basic rules for the development of
    minor versions.
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style='numbers'>
      <t>
        Procedures are not added or deleted.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        To maintain the general Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model, NFSv4 minor versions will not
        add to or delete procedures from the NFS program.
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions may add operations to the COMPOUND and
        CB_COMPOUND procedures.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The addition of operations to the COMPOUND and CB_COMPOUND
        procedures does not affect the RPC model.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Minor versions may append attributes to the bitmap4 that
            represents sets of attributes and to the fattr4 that
            represents sets of attribute values.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            This allows for the expansion of the attribute model to allow
            for future growth or adaptation.
          </t>

          <t>
            Minor version X must append any new attributes after the last
            documented attribute.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Since attribute results are specified as an opaque array of
            per-attribute, XDR-encoded results, the complexity of adding
            new attributes in the midst of the current definitions would
            be too burdensome.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions must not modify the structure of an existing
        operation's arguments or results.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Again, the complexity of handling multiple structure definitions
        for a single operation is too burdensome.  New operations should
        be added instead of modifying existing structures for a minor
        version.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        This rule does not preclude the following adaptations in a minor
        version:
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            adding bits to flag fields, such as new attributes to
            GETATTR's bitmap4 data type, and providing corresponding
            variants of opaque arrays, such as a notify4 used together
            with such bitmaps
          </t>

          <t>
            adding bits to existing attributes like Access Control Lists (ACL) that have flag
            words
          </t>

          <t>
            extending enumerated types (including NFS4ERR_*) with new
            values
          </t>

          <t>
            adding cases to a switched union
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Note that when adding new cases to a switched union, a minor
        version must not make new cases be REQUIRED. While the encapsulating
        operation may be REQUIRED, the new cases (the specific arm
        of the discriminated union) is not. The error code
        NFS4ERR_UNION_NOTSUPP is used to notify the client when the
        server does not support such a case.
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions must not modify the structure of existing
        attributes.
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions must not delete operations.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        This prevents the potential reuse of a particular operation
        "slot" in a future minor version.
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions must not delete attributes.
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions must not delete flag bits or enumeration values.
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions may declare an operation MUST NOT be implemented.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Specifying that an operation MUST NOT be implemented is
        equivalent to obsoleting an operation.  For the client, it means
        that the operation MUST NOT be sent to the server.  For the
        server, an NFS error can be returned as opposed to "dropping"
        the request as an XDR decode error.  This approach allows for
        the obsolescence of an operation while maintaining its structure
        so that a future minor version can reintroduce the operation.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>
            Minor versions may declare that an attribute MUST NOT be
            implemented.
          </t>

          <t>
            Minor versions may declare that a flag bit or enumeration
            value MUST NOT be implemented.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions may declare an operation to be OBSOLESCENT, which
        indicates an intention to remove the operation (i.e., make it
        MANDATORY TO NOT implement) in a subsequent minor version.  Such
        labeling is separate from the question of whether the operation
        is REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED or OPTIONAL in the current minor
        version.  An operation may be both REQUIRED for the given minor
        version and marked OBSOLESCENT, with the expectation that it
        will be MANDATORY TO NOT implement in the next (or other
        subsequent) minor version.
      </t>

      <t>
        Note that the early notification of operation obsolescence is
        put in place to mitigate the effects of design and
        implementation mistakes, and to allow protocol development to
        adapt to unexpected changes in the pace of implementation.  Even
        if an operation is marked OBSOLESCENT in a given minor version,
        it may end up not being marked MANDATORY TO NOT implement in the
        next minor version.  In unusual circumstances, it might not be
        marked OBSOLESCENT in a subsequent minor version, and never
        become MANDATORY TO NOT implement.
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions may downgrade features from REQUIRED to
        RECOMMENDED, from RECOMMENDED to OPTIONAL, or from OPTIONAL to
        MANDATORY TO NOT implement.  Also, if a feature was marked as
        OBSOLESCENT in the prior minor version, it may be downgraded
        from REQUIRED to OPTIONAL from RECOMMENDED to MANDATORY TO NOT
        implement, or from REQUIRED to MANDATORY TO NOT implement.
      </t>

      <t>
        Minor versions may upgrade features from OPTIONAL to
        RECOMMENDED, or RECOMMENDED to REQUIRED.  Also, if a feature was
        marked as OBSOLESCENT in the prior minor version, it may be
        upgraded to not be OBSOLESCENT.
      </t>

      <t>
        A client and server that support minor version X SHOULD support
        minor versions 0 through X-1 as well.
      </t>

      <t>
        Other than where explicitly documented in a minor version's 
        specification document, except for infrastructural changes,
        a minor version must not introduce REQUIRED new features.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        This rule allows for the introduction of new functionality and
        forces the use of implementation experience before designating a
        feature as REQUIRED.  On the other hand, some classes of
        features are infrastructural and have broad effects.  Allowing
        infrastructural features to be RECOMMENDED or OPTIONAL
        complicates implementation of the minor version.
      </t>

      <t>
        A client MUST NOT attempt to use a stateid, filehandle, or
        similar returned object from the COMPOUND procedure with minor
        version X for another COMPOUND procedure with minor version Y,
        where X != Y.
      </t>
    </list>
