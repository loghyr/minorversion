<section anchor="ss:mods" title="Modifying the minor version rules">
  <t>
    The minor versioning rules had been being maintained inside the
    various Standards Track RFCs, which had the impact of the minor
    versioning rules being modified as needed per release of the
    minor versions. The rules for minor versions SHOULD stand outside
    the minor versions and be tracked by their own Standard Track RFCs.
    As such, all modifications to the minor versioning rules MUST
    be documented not in the minor version documents, but in
    Standard Track RFCs which are focused entirely on the minor
    versioning rules themselves.
