<section anchor="ss:mods" title="Consolidation of the Minor Version Rules">
  <t>
    Previously, versioning rules had been being maintained and
    specified in the Standards Track RFCs, defining the individual
    minor versions.  As a result, versioning rules were modified
    on an ad hoc basis for each new minor version.
  </t>

  <t>
    This document defines a set of versioning rules, including rules
    for minor version construction, that applies to the NFSv4
    protocol as a whole.  The rules are subject to change but any
    such change should be part of a standards track RFC obsoleting
    or updating this document.
  </t>

  <t>
    This document supersedes the minor versioning rules appearing
    in the minor version specification RFC's.  As a result potential
    conflicts among these documents should be addressed as follows:

    <list style='symbols'>
      <t>
       The specification of the actual protocols for minor versions
       previously published as Proposed Standards take precedence
       over minor versioning rules in either this document or in
       the minor version specification RFC's.  In other words, if
       the transition from version A to version B violates a minor
       versioning rules, the protocol stays as it is.
      </t>

      <t>
       Otherwise, any conflict between the minor versioning rules
       in this document and those in minor version specification
       RFC's are to be resolved based on the treatment in this
       document.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    Future minor version specification documents should avoid
    specifying minor versioning rules and reference this document
    in connection with rules for minor versions.
