    To address the requirement of an NFS protocol that can evolve
    as the need arises, the Network File System (NFS) version 4
    (NFSv4) protocol contains the rules and framework to allow for
    future minor changes or versioning. These versioning rules SHOULD
    maintain compatibility with existing clients and servers.
  </t>

  <t>
    A large portion of such changes will be part of new minor versions. 
    The COMPOUND procedure (see Section 14.2 of <xref target="RFC3530" />)
    specifies the minor version being used by the client.  The
    CB_COMPOUND (see Section 15.2 of <xref target="RFC3530" />)
    procedure specifies the minor version being used by the server
    on callbacks.
  </t>

  <t>
    Each minor version is specified by one or more standards track RFC:

    <list style='hanging'>
      <t hangText='Minor version 0'>
        is specified by <xref target="RFC3530" />
      </t>

      <t hangText='Minor version 1'>
        is specified principally by <xref target='RFC5661' />
      </t>

      <t hangText='Minor version 2'>
        is specified principally by <xref target='NFSv42' />.  
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    In addition to the creation of new minor versions, two other
    sorts of versioning are discussed in this document:

    <list style='symbols'>
      <t>
        Addition of OPTIONAL features to existing minor versions.
      </t>

      <t>
        XDR-based extensions used to correct protocol bugs in existing
        minor versions or associated features.
      </t>
    </list>
